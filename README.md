# S-P-500-Stocks
Examined the returns, components, and volatility of the S&P 500 index and identified stocks with high and low performance.

## Summary of Findings

In conclusion, the analysis of the PE ratio, revenue growth, market capitalization,
and sector and industry performance of the companies in the dataset suggests several key findings.
Firstly, companies with a PE ratio higher than 0.0000005 are considered overvalued.
Secondly, the mean revenue growth is 0.13%, with 75% of the stocks falling below 0.18%.
Stocks above 0.18% have shown better performance than others.
The technology and energy sectors have the highest revenue growth.
With respect to market capitalization, 75% of the companies fall under 55B, with a mean of around 45B,
indicating that all companies with a larger market capitalization than 55B are considered large-cap stocks.
The technology, financial services, healthcare, and industrials sectors have the highest market capitalization,
while the consumer electronics, software-infrastructure, and insurance-diversified industries have the highest market capitalization.
In 2019, all sectors experienced an increase, with energy showing the most growth.
However, in 2020, all sectors experienced a decrease, possibly due to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In 2022, all sectors are experiencing sharp declines, with the energy sector experiencing the sharpest decline.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the ways to measure the performance of stocks:
1. Market capitalization: Market cap is a measure of a company's size and can be used to determine
whether a stock is considered a large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap stock
2. Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio): The P/E ratio is a commonly used metric
to determine the relative value of a stock. Stocks with a low P/E ratio are generally
considered to be undervalued, while those with a high P/E ratio are considered to be overvalued.
3. Revenue growth: The revenue growth can be used to measure the performance of a stock over time.
Stocks with high revenue growth are generally considered to be performing well.
4. Volume: The volume of a stock can be used to measure the level of interest in the stock.
Stocks with high volume are generally considered to be more liquid and easier to trade.

Afterwards, I introduce a Correlation Heatmap to examine the elationship between the numeric variables.
